    <h4>Rural Schooling</h4>
    <p>Hey there, I am Aditya (Male 19yrs). To introduce myself, I would like to take you back a little in time. I was born in a small village named Sarfabad, it is situated in Jind district of state Haryana, India. It was 2005 and from then there is lot of things i learnt. i completed my schooling till 8th class in some local schools, but that made a strong foundation of my studies. After that i got admission in <a href="https://www.sskunjpura.org/">Sainik School Kunjpura</a>.</p>
    <h4>Urban Schooling</h4>
    <p>Maybe most of you don't know but it was a big achievement for me at that time. This school taught me a lot of things like Self-study, Social interactions, Physical Fitness, and logically tackling unwanted situations without stresing out. It provides the best foundation to get into defence sector. I tried for NDA (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defence_Academy_(India)">National Defence Academy</a>) and passed it's exam twice but was't able to pass SSB (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Services_Selection_Board">Service Selection Board</a>).</p>
    <h4>Drop Year</h4>
    <p>I explored and learnt a lot in those days after my 12th class when i gave my one year to preparation of SSB but was't able to make it. So I applied for some colleges and got the chance to study in Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai (<a href="https://chennai.vit.ac.in/">VITC</a>). </p>
    <h4>College 1st year</h4>
    <p>In August 2023, I joined VITC as a CS core student. Although I learnt the basics of coding in my 12th class via learning Python, I had to gear up and learnt more complex logics in my Semester 1 in Python. I was not familier with Tech sector that much, that's why I had to suffer a little in my 1st year. 1sem was quite easy still I scored a GPA of 8.64 (was not satisfied with it though). Then I got to know how competetive the college life and this Tech sector can be!! In my 2nd Sem, I added a new language to my skillset and that was C/C++, yes the base and foundation of all coding world(yeah, maybe i overhyped this one). Although it was quite difficult in starting, but as the sem come to an end, I was quite fluent in it.I learnt C language, and C++ OOPs concept (Object Oriented Programmming). I learn basics of <a href="https://in.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MATLAB</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHDL#:~:text=VHDL%20(VHSIC%20Hardware%20Description%20Language,%2C%20documentation%2C%20and%20verification%20purposes.">VHDL</a> in the process of scoring an average grade of total 8.74 cgpa in 1st year. I learnt all these thing via documentations, following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVMnSShP_Iviwkknt83cww">Code With Harry YT channel</a> and <a href="https://www.programiz.com/">Programiz website tutorials</a>.</p>
    <h4>Vacations</h4>
    <p>Okay, This may be the fun part for every other college student, but for me it is the grinding time. Because my parents can't see their grown up child lying on a bed or chair spending time on phone screen or sleeping late. And my father needs me in plaground by 5am. So yeah, it's not fun according to most of the guys I know. That's why I like hostel than home but I get used to it. So, I had to find something to learn in my vacations otherwise my parents will surely find some work from here and there for me. So I thought of getting into WebDev and plan for my upcoming semester. So, thats what I am doing now!!</p>
    <h4>What's Next?</h4>
    <p>So, my plans are simple. With time your knowledge, intelligence and experience increases. So I make achievable short term plans and grind to achieve them. And yeah, The pic I pasted above was just clicked 5 days ago. It may be a trasition of studying in engineering. </p>
